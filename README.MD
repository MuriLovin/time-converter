# Time Converter CLI Application

This command-line application is designed to convert a time in 12-hour AM/PM format to military (24-hour) time. It's part of a HackerRank challenge aimed at testing your programming and problem-solving skills.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this application, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- C++ Compiler: You need a C++ compiler installed on your system to compile and run the application.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Navigate to the directory where the `main.cpp` file is located.

3. Compile the C++ source code using your preferred compiler. For example, if you're using `g++`, run the following command:

   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 src/main.cpp -o bin/main
   ```

4. Run the compiled executable:

   ```bash
   ./bin/main
   ```

5. Follow the on-screen prompts to input a time in 12-hour AM/PM format (e.g., "04:30:00PM").

6. The application will convert the input time to military (24-hour) time and display the result.

## Example

Input:
```
Enter a time in 12-hour AM/PM format: 07:45:00PM
```

Output:
```
Military time: 19:45:00
```

## Challenge

This CLI application is part of a HackerRank challenge. The challenge might require you to implement the time conversion logic and handle various edge cases. Be sure to read the challenge instructions thoroughly and consider different scenarios when implementing your solution.

## Acknowledgments

- This application is inspired by the HackerRank challenge.

In this version, I've made sure to reflect that the application is written in C++ and included instructions for compiling and running C++ code. Make sure to replace `main.cpp` with the actual name of your C++ source file that implements the time conversion logic.
